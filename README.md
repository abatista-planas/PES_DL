# PES_DL

A Potential Energy Surface (PES) generator using deep learning, designed to reconstruct high-dimensional energy landscapes from a minimal set of ab initio reference points.

## Overview

**PES_DL** enables the construction of multidimensional potential energy surfaces using a sparse set of ab initio calculated energies. By leveraging advanced deep learning techniques—specifically Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)—this tool can interpolate and predict the full PES with high accuracy, reducing the computational cost and enabling efficient exploration of molecular systems.

## Features

- Generate full-dimensional PES from a limited number of ab initio points
- GAN-based architecture for robust and flexible surface generation
- Suitable for high-dimensional systems
- Utilizes deep learning for accurate interpolation
- Supports common input formats for ab initio data
- Modular and extensible design

## Use Cases

- Quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics simulations
- Efficient exploration of complex molecular surfaces

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abatista-planas/PES_DL.git
cd PES_DL
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. Prepare a set of ab initio energy points (input format: [describe format, e.g., CSV, XYZ, etc.]).
2. Run the PES generator:

```bash
python pes_dl.py --input your_points.xyz --output pes_surface.dat
```

3. [Add more usage examples or command-line options as needed.]
